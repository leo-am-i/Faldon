I left 2 really simple and basic examples here, you will need way more than that to build good scripts, to be honest it's the core of all you need to make any script, but you'll need to put your brain to work a little to get the rest (decoding game packets, building scripts logic, etc).


castAntimagic basically casts Antimagic spell every x seconds, user enter x value. You need to manually set char ID though, or a better solution is creating a char ID finder that will dynamically get the char ID.

magma golem script simply send one attacking monster packet every 345 milliseconds. You have to manually change the monster id in the attacking packet to the magma golem id, there are several ways to find its id.
